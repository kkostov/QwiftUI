# Contributing to QwiftUI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to QwiftUI! This project is an experiment in building a Swift UI library based on Qt6, with a focus on minimal dependencies and cross-platform support. We welcome your ideas, bug reports, and code contributions.

## How You Can Contribute

### Answer Issues and Join Discussions

Reviewing issues and merged pull requests is a great way to help, get familiar with the library, and shape its direction.

### Contribute to the QwiftUI Codebase

- Clone the `main` branch to your machine.
- Open the folder in your preferred editor with Swift support.

#### Run and Add Tests

- You can run tests using Swift Package Manager commands (e.g. `swift test`).
- Each addition to the codebase that introduces something new, or changes the way an existing piece of code works, should add or update relevant tests.

#### Please Respect the Existing Coding Style

- Get familiar with the [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/).
- Use spaces, not tabs.
- Whitespace-only lines are not trimmed.
- We recommend using [swift-format](https://github.com/apple/swift-format) to ensure a consistent look and feel of the library code. Your changes should contain no swift-format errors or warnings. Please lint code contributions before submitting.
- Avoid bringing in new libraries or dependencies without good justification. Any PR that brings in a new library needs to make the case for why it is necessary.

#### Provide Documentation for Your Changes

- All methods and types that the library makes public should have a meaningful description and information on how to use them.
- It is recommended to include unit tests covering your changes.
- Optionally, you may consider extending one of the examples to showcase new functionality.

#### Communication

We'd love to hear from you! Feel free to reach out to the maintainers:

#### No AI-generated Pull Requests

We do not accept pull requests that are fully or primarily generated by AI tools. You are welcome to use automation or AI tools to assist your development process, but all contributions must be written, reviewed, understood, and presented by a human contributor.

#### Open a Pull Request

When you're ready, open a pull request with your changes (targeting the `main` branch) and describe your changes clearly.

Thank you for helping make QwiftUI better!
